These are notes I took while watching the video course [The Great Trials of World History and the Lessons They Teach Us](https://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/the-great-trials-of-world-history-and-the-lessons-they-teach-us), by Douglas O. Linder, J.D., Professor, University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law.  All research was done by Linder; these notes are my summarization of the information presented in these videos.
