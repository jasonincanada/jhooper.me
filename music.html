  Below is my first (and still only) piano song, composed and performed by me in April 2007 on my Clavinova CLP-230 (with some light effects added afterwards on my computer).  All of my other music is composed digitally with tracking software over the years. Some of the tracks are published on my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jason-hooper">SoundCloud page</a>.
