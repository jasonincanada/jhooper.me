title: The Gravediggers
---

I'm being buried by two men, but I am still alive.  My seemingly dead body has just been tossed into a freshly dug grave, not in a cemetary, but into a dirt pit dug about six feet underneath the floor of a basement of the home of these two men.  I am only pretending to be dead, so I'm able to listen to them chat dispassionately to each other about some unrelated thing, like this is something they do regularly and is just another time they are doing it.  There is no hint of guilt or conspiracy in their demeanour; this is just another casual job for them, uninteresting in comparison to the topic of their discussion.

I am still alive however, and only pretending to be dead, having stopped my breathing almost entirely.  I fully intended to do this, and know it won't kill me, so I am very calm, like an actual cadaver.  I was thrown into the pit on my right side, and now they're shoveling piles of cold, gritty dirt onto me, hitting my left cheek first and eventually covering my whole body.  Their voices slowly quiet to a muffle as the layers of dirt are piled on, until everything is black and silent.

Immediately upon their finishing the burial, I jolt upright and rise quickly through the dirt, through the floor of the basement and back into the room I was buried in.  Although no time has passed for me, it has been about a year for the two men, who jump to their feet quite surprised that I'm standing there in front of them.  Their shock is quickly overtaken by panic and fear of an insect that has come up from the ground with me.  It starts crawling towards them, so they jump up on chairs and tables to evade it.  The more they try to get away from it, however, the faster it moves, until it is dashing at light speed around the room, throwing them into fits of panic.
