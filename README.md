## jhooper.me

This is the [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) source for my personal homepage at [jhooper.me](https://jhooper.me).  This isn't necessarily the best way to build a homepage, but I challenged myself to do it to get more experience with Haskell, particularly using monads, which Hakyll is elegantly constructed with.
