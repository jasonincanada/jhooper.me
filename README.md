## jhooper.me

This is the [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) source for my personal homepage at [jhooper.me](https://jhooper.me).  This isn't necessarily the best way to build a homepage, but I challenged myself to do it to get more experience with Haskell, particularly using monads, which Hakyll is elegantly constructed with.

Points of interest:

* [src/Site.hs](src/Site.hs) - Main site definition
* [links/1-linkedin.md](links/1-linkedin.md) - Example of a data file (click Raw to avoid GitHub's attempt to render it). This feeds into the main links on the homepage.
